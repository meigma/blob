This is sample data for the provenance example.

It demonstrates that blob archives can contain arbitrary file hierarchies
that are compressed and stored efficiently in OCI registries.

When pulled with provenance verification, these files are guaranteed to:
1. Come from a sigstore-signed source (Fulcio certificate + Rekor transparency log)
2. Have been built by the expected GitHub Actions workflow
3. Match the expected repository and identity policies
