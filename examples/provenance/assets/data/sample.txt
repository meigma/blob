This is sample data for the provenance example.

It demonstrates that blob archives can contain arbitrary file hierarchies
that are compressed and stored efficiently in OCI registries.

When pulled with provenance verification, these files are guaranteed to:
1. Come from a signed and verified source
2. Have valid SLSA provenance attestations
3. Match the expected builder and repository policies
